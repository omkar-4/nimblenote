## MOST IMP
- feature 1 : input textbox
  - padding, borderless, 
- feature 2 : + new note btn on right, sidebar [| ] on left
- feature 3 : onboarding (ask root folder location)
  - on app start check if the config file exists / config settings values exist
  - if yes open the app work area, if no open splash to give option to set root folder
- feature 4 : autosave

what would be onboarding?
- this app autosaves everything in a specific root folder
- if root is not set, show omboarding screen to select & define root folder, else show work area.
